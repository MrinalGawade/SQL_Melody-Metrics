The process of gathering insights and making data-driven decisions based on data collected from a music store's sales and 
inventory systems is known as music store analysis using SQL. T
he goal is to improve sales, inventory management, customer engagement, and overall company performance. 

This includes analysing sales data to identify trends, popular products, and revenue growth opportunities,
monitoring inventory levels and identifying slow-moving products, understanding customer purchasing patterns and behaviour,
analysing pricing data to determine optimal pricing strategies, and measuring marketing campaign effectiveness. 
SQL queries are used to extract insights and answer business questions, allowing music store owners to make well-informed decisions 
and take actions that will propel their business forward.
